# ROS
Code used for the next-generation RNA sequencing analysis accompanying the manuscript "Endogenous Redox levels delineate functional heterogeneity and responsiveness of adult hippocampal stem cells in mice".
Two experiments are described; 
* An comparison of the two neurogenic niches of the adult mouse hippocampus.
* Characterisation of the Nestin-positive neural precursor cells sorted on the basis of ROS (reactive oxygen species) content.
All analysis has been performed using R/BioConductor.
Raw sequencing data can be found at [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the SuperSeries accession [GSE124095](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE124095).
